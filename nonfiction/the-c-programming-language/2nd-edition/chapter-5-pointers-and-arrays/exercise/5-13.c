/*
 * Exercise 5-13
 *
 * Write the program tail, which prints the last n lines of its
 * input.
 *
 * By default, n is 10, let us say, but it can be changed by the
 * optional argument, so that
 *
 *      tail -n
 *
 * prints the last n lines.
 *
 * The program should behave rationally no matter how unreasonable the
 * input or the value of n.
 *
 * Write the program so it makes the best use of available storage;
 * lines should be stored as in the sorting program of Section 5.6,
 * not in a two-dimensional array of fixed size.
