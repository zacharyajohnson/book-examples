Not much notes, as this is a practical section.
See example/scanner for the implementation

Lexeme - the smallest unit of characters grouped together
that represent something
        Ex: var language = "lox";
        Each word / symbol means something in the langauge
        and are lexemes

Token - The lexeme bundled with other data such as:
token type, value(for lexemes that are strings, numbers),
what line it shows up in, etc

Lexical grammar - the rules that determine how a particular language groups
characters into lexemes

Lox and most programming languages lexical grammars are regular languages, or can be represented
with regular expressions
