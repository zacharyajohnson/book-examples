7.1: Representing Values
        In Lox, values are created by literals, computed by expressions,
        and stored in variables

        Since Lox is dynamic, we need to map that to some class in Java
        that can represent any of our data types. This is the Object
        class

        Lox type                Java representation
        Any Lox value           Object
        nil                     null
        Boolean                 Boolean
        number                  Double
        string                  String

        During runtime we can check what type of value the Object class
        is by using the instanceof operator

7.2: Evaluating Expressions
        This is the section with the code to evaluate expressions
        See Interpreter.java
        
        Uses the Visitor pattern

7.3: Runtime Errors
        Error handling code is written here.
        Mainly is checking that the types we expect for certain
        operators are correct

7.4: Hooking Up the Interpreter
        Sets up the interpreter to evaluate the
        expressions we evaluate in main
