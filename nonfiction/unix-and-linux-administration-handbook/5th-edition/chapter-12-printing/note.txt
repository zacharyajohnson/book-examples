CUPS
        Printing system used by Linux / FreeBSD

        Network / security aware

        Has GUI / shell scripts to control it

Printing relies on
        A print "spooler" that collects / schedules jobs

        User level utilities that talk to the spooler
                Send jobs to spooler

                Query system about jobs

                Remove / reschedule jobs

                Configure other parts of the system

        Back ends that talk to printer hardware

        A network protocol that lets spoolers communicate
        and transfer jobs
