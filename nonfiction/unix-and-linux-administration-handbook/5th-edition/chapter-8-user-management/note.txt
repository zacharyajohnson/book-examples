Focues on adding/removing users

8.1: Account Mechanics
        A user is nothing but an unsigned 32-bit integer known
        as a user ID(UID)

        Everything related to account management revolves around
        UIDs
                All kernel calls take UID as an arg to get info

                Kernel API's traditionally looked up user info
                in /etc/passwd

8.2: The /etc/passwd File
        List of users recognized by systems

        Can be replaced or extended by one or more
        directory services

        world-readable

        Historically stored encrypted passwords, but with increasing
        processing power being able to crack them, they
        were moved to /etc/shadow, which is not world readable. Now
        it only contains a placeholder entry for passwords

        Consulted at login time to determine user info

        Each line is one user and has the following fields seperated by colons
                Login name
                Encrypted password placeholder
                UID(User ID) number
                Default GID(Group ID) number
                Optional "GECOS" info: full name, office, extension, home phone
                Home directory
                Login shell

        Login Name
                Username

                Must be unique, and may have set character restrictions

                Max limit of 32 characters

                Can't contain colons or newlines(Used in /etc/passwd)

                Case sensitive, traditionally all lowercase letters

        UID(User ID) Number
                Root(UID 0)

                Psuedo-users
                        bin
                        daemon

                        Have fake logins/shells to prevent loging in

                        Used to be owners of commands or files

                Should be kept unique accross orgs
                        LDAP is a popular solution

                Do not recycle UIDS

        Default GID(Group ID) Number
                GID - 32 bit unsigned integer

                GID 0 - root/system/wheel

                Historically used to track resource usuage and charge groups
                accordingly

                Now, mainly used to share access to files

                /etc/group - defines system groups

                Provides an "effective" GID at login time

                Only used in the creation of new files or directories

        GECOS Field
                Used to record personal info about each user

                No well defined syntax

                Most common syntax is comma seperated and the following entries
                in the listed order:
                        Full name
                        Office number and building
                        Office telephone extension
                        Home phone number

                chfn
                        Change user GECO info

                        Usually only understands /etc/passwd
                        and not any other directory services

        Home Directory
                Users default directory at login time

                Used by login shells to look for account specific
                customizations such as
                        Shell aliases
                        Environment variables
                        SSH Keys
                        Server fingerprints
                        Program state

                If missing on login, may display erros or not allow
                login at all depending on configuration

        Login Shell
                Normally a command interpretor

                Can be any program

                Default shells
                        FreeBSD - sh
                        Linux - bash

                chsh
                        Allow users to change shell

                        Might not work if using LDAP

8.3: The Linux /etc/shadow file
        Readable only by root

        Stores users encrypted passwords

        Default on all systems

        Completly seperate from /etc/passd. Both files
        must be maintained

        One line for each user

        Each line has nine fields seperated by a colon
                Login name

                Encrypted password

                Date of last password change

                Mininum number of days between password chagnes

                Maximum number of days between password changes

                Number of days in advance to warn users about password expiration

                Days after password expiration that account is disabled

                Account expiration date

                A filed reserved for future use which is currently always empty

        Only username and password is required

        Absolute date fields are specified as the number of days since January 1, 1970

8.5: The /etc/group file
        Contains the name of UNIX grousp and a list of each groups members

        Each line represents one group
                Group name
                Encrypted password or placeholder
                GID number
                List of members, seperated by commas(Be careful with spaces)
                Seperated by colons

        If a user defaults to a group in /etc/passwd but does not appear in the group
        in /etc/group, /etc/passwd wins the argument

        useradd/adduser add new users to their own personal group

        groupadd, groupmod, groupdel

8.6: Manual Setps for Adding Users
        Editing the Passwd and Group Files
                vipw
                        Edit shadow/password files

                        Invokes editor defined by EDITOR environment variable

                        -s: edit shadowfile

                vigr
                        Edit /etc/group

                        Same as above

        Setting a password
                sudo passwd {username}

        Setting Home Directory Ownershp and Permissions
                sudo chown -R {user}:{group} ~/{user}

8.7: Scripts for Adding Users: useradd
        useradd on Linux
                Config paramters from
                        /etc/login.defs
                        /etc/default/useradd

                login.defs
                        Defines
                                Password aging
                                Encryption algorithms
                                Ranges of UIDs/GIDs

                /etc/default/useradd
                        Include
                                Default location of home directories

                                Default shell for new users

                        Can be changed with useradd -D

                /etc/skel
                        Skeleton rc files for shells

                sudo useradd username
                        Create user

                        Disables by default, must set password to use

                userdel - Delete user

                usermod -L / usermod -u
                        Lock/unlock user accounts
