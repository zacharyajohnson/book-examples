20.1: I Just Want to Add a Disk!
        Steps
                Attach a drive

        Linux Recipe
                lsblk - List sytem disks
                        Use to identify new drive

                Install partition table to disk
                        parted
                        gparted
                        fdisk
                        cfdisk
                        sfdisk

                Create parition with above commands

                mkfs - create filesystem in partition
                        Ex: sudo mkfs -t ext4 -L spare /dev/sdb1
                                Creates ext4 file system at /dev/sdb1
                                partition

                                Has label "spare"
                                        Can be used to refrence drive like
                                        in mount

                                        Persists even if device name changes

                Create mount point and mount paritition
                        Ex: sudo mkdir /spare
                            sudo mount LABEL=spare /spare

                Edit /etc/fstab to have filesystem automatically mounted at boot time
                        Ex: LABEL=spare /spare ext4 errors=remound-ro 0 0

                        Relability: Poor
                        Limited Writes: In theory

        Hard Disks
                Physical Parts
                        Several rotating plates coated with magnetic film

                        Read / written to by tiny skating heads mounted
                        on a metal arm that swings back and forth to
                        position them

                Since operations are physical there are delays if the arm needs
                repositioned

        Hard Disk Relability
                Fail frequently

                Hard disks that are > two years old have annual failure rate (AFR)
                of 6%

                75% of disks don't make it to five years

                        Mechanical failures

                Drives will attempt to correct bad by moving data
                to a different block

        Drive Types
                Only two manifactuers of hard drives
                        Seagate
                        Western Digital

                Value drives
                        Lots of storage
                        Low price point

                NAS drives
                        Intended to be used anywhere where multiple drives
                        are housed and accessed together

                        Designed to be constantly on and working

                        Balance performance, reliability, and low

        Solid State Disks
                Spreads reads and writes accross banks of flash memory cells

                Cells are individually slower than HDDs, but are overall faster
                because of parallelism

                Perform well wwhen data is read / written more randomly

                More expensive per GB

                        tinyurl.com/dexnbt

        Rewritability Limits
                Each poge of flash memory can only be rewritten a number
                of times (typically 100,000)
                        Writes are distributed accross
                        pages via firmware

                        Stream 100MB/s of data to a 500GB SSD for 15 continous
                        years to hit limit

        Flash memory and Controller Types
                Constructed from serveral types of flash memory

                Main difference is how much info is stored in each location
                        Single level cells (SCC memories)
                                Store single bit
                                Fastest, most expensive

                        Multilevel cells (MCC)

                        Triple-level ceells (TLC)

                Controllers that controol SSDs are still evolving
                        Most companies are open to what they use

20.3: Storage Hardware Interfaces
        The SATA Interface
                Serial ATA
                
                Predominant hardware interface for storage

                Supports high transfer routes (6GB/s)

                Native support for hot-swapping and (optional) command
                querying

        The PCI Express Interface
                Perpheral COmponent Interconnect Express

                Used on PC motherboard for decade plus

                Perdominal standard for connecting all kinds
                of add-on circuit boards

                Flexible and fast signal rate

                Faster than SATA

        USB
                Universal Serial Bus

                Used to connect external hard drives or USB
                thumb drives

                USB 3.1 - 10 GB/s

                Storage devices never come with native USB interfaces
                        Usuually SATA drives will have a protocol
                        converter built into the enclosure
                                Can buy enclosure seperatly
                                and mnaully install hard disk of choice

20.4: Attachment and Low-Level Management of Devices
        Disk Device Files
                Newly added disk is represented as device file in
                /dev

                Ex:
                        Whole Disk: /dev/sda
                        Partition: /dev/sda1

        Ephemeral Device Names
                Disk names are assigned in sequence as kernel adds
                new devices

                Adding a disk or restarting the sytem can cause an
                existing name to change

                Never
                        Make changes to dis/partitions without identifying
                        identity of disk

                        Mention a disk driver in a config file. It can change

                /dev/disk - Lists disk by various stable characteristics

                parted -l
                        List sizes, partition tables, model numbers, and
                        manufacturers of every disk on the system

        ATA Secure Erase
                PATA / SATA

                "Secure Erase" command
                        Overwrites data on disks that prevents recovery
                        efforts

                        U.S. Department of Defense approved for security levels
                        less than "secret"

                rm -rf does not erase data, leaves everything intact and
                recoverable with software

                Multiple erases on disk

                Resets SSD to fully erased state

                        Detailed form of status reporting

                        Four params have a 56% percent change of predicting
                        drive failure
                                Scan error count

                                Number of sectors on probation

                        All params should be zero.

20.5: The Software Side of Storage: Peeling the Onion
        Elements of a Storage System
                Storage Device
                        Anything that looks like a disk

                        Ex: Hard disk, flash drive, SSD, RAID array

                        Allows random access, handles block I/O, represented
                        by device file

                Partition
                        Fixed size subsection of storage device

                        Has own device file, ad acts like independent
                        storage device

                Volume Groups / Logical Volumes
                        Associated with logical volume managers(LVMs)
                                Aggregate physical devices to form pools
                                of storage called volume groups

                        Volume group - can be subdivided into logical volumes

                RAID Array
                        Redundant Array of Inexpensive / Independent Disks

                        Combines multiple storage devices into one virtualized device

                        Can include anything that acts like disk

                        Implemented by OS or hardware

                Filesystem
                        Mediates between raw hardware adn the interface people expects

                        Detrmines
                                Where and how contents of ifle are stored

                                How filesyste namesapace is represented and searched
                                on disk

                                How system is made resistent to corruption

20.6: Disk Partitioning
        Divides up a disk into sperate chunks of knwon size

        Traditionally
                Lowest level of disk management

                Only disks could be partitioned

                No longer true

        Perfer logical volume management

        No snapshot management, difficult to reverse

        Simple and everything understands it

        All systems have root "partition"
                Includes / and local host config data

        Subdirectories, /var, /usr, /tmp, etc can be seperated
        into seperate partitions

        General Guidelines
                Put /var on its own partition to prevent
                logs filling up disk

                Put /home dir in seperate partition in case
                root partition dies

        Linux Partitioning
                gparted and parted

20.7: Logical Volume Management
        Allows relocation of space dynamically from partitions

        Groups individual storage devices into "volume groups"

        The blocks in a volume group can be allocted to "logical volumes",
        which are represented by block disk files and act like disk partitions

        More flexible and powerful than disk partitions

        Can
                Move logical volumes among different physical devices

                Grow and shrink logical volumes on the fly

                Take copy on write snapshots of logical volumes

                Replace on-line drives without interrupting service

                Incorporate mirroing or striping in logical volumes

        Can be put together in variety of ways
                Concatenation
                        Keeps each disk physical blocks together

                        Lines up devices one after another

                Striping
                        Interleaves components so that adjacent
                        blocks are spread over multiple physical
                        disks

        Linux Logical Volume Management
                LVM2

                LVM commands in Linux
                        Physical Volume
                                Create - pvcreate
                                Inspect - pvdisplay
                                Modify - pvchange
                                check - pvck

                        Volume Group
                                Create - vgcreate
                                Inspect - vgchange

                                Inspect - vgdisplay
                                Check - vgck
                                Enable - vgscan

                        Logical Volume
                                Create: lvcreate
                                Modify: lvchange
                                Resize: lvresize
                                Inspect: lvdisplay

                Individual disk and partitions (physical volumes)
                are gathered into storage pools called volume groups

                Volume groups are subdivided into logical volumes, which contain
                filesystems

                "Physical Volumes" can be
                        Disks
                        Disk Partitions
                        RAID arrays

                Can be managed through lvm command / subcommands

20.8: RAID: Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks
        A system that distributes or replicates data cross multiple disks

        Helps avoid data loss, minimize downtime, and potentially increases performance

        Can be implemented in hardware and software

        RAID levels
                RAID does two things
                        Improve performance by "striping" data across multiple
                        drives

                        Replicate data across multiple drives, decreasing risk
                        associated with a failed disk

                Two forms of replication
                        Mirroring
                                Data blocks are reproduced bit for bit on
                                several different drives

                        Parity Schemes
                                One or more drivers contain an error correcting
                                checksum of the blocks on the remaining data drives

                        Mirroring is faster but consumes more space. Parity schemas are more
                        space efficent but has lower performance

                RAID is configured into levels, which specify details of the
                paralleism and redundancy implemented by the array

                RAID 0
                        Increases performance

                        Combines two or more drives of equal size

                        Stripes data alternativly among disks in pool

                        Reads / writes are spread amoung several disks
                                Improves write / access times

                        Has terrible reliability compared to seperate disks

                RAID 1
                        Mirroring

                        Writes are duplicated to two or more drives simultaneously

                        Makes writing slower compared to single drive

                        Makes reading faster since there are multiple disks

                RAID 1 + 0
                        Stripes of mirrors

                RAID 0 + 1
                        Mirrors of stripes

                RAID 5
                        Stripes both data and parity info

                        Adds redundancy and improves read
                        performance

                        More efficant in disk space than RAID 1
                                67% vs 50%

                        Can handle one drive failure

                RAID 6
                        Similar to RAID 5

                        Two parity disks

                        Can handle two drive failures without losing data

                RAID 2-4 are rarely used

                RAID 0 and RAID 1 features are included in logical volume managers

                ZFS and BTRFS support RAID, logical volume managers, and file systems
                in one package

        mdadm: Linux Software RAID
                md - "multiple disks" driver
                        Linux software RAID implementation

                        Uses mdadm

                mdadm
                        Config
                                /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
                                /etc/mdadm.conf

20.10: Traditional Filesystems: UFS, EXT4 and XFS
        Seperate code bases and histories

        Old school approach
                Volume management and RAID
                implemented seperatly

                Limited to file storage on block devices
                of defined size

        ZFS / BTRFS include everything, next gen filesystem
