Log management includes the following tasks
        Collecting logs form a variety of sources

        Providng a structured interface for querying,
        analyzing, filtering, and monitoring messages

        Managing the retention and expiration of messages
        so that info is kept as long as it is potentially
        useful or legally required, but not indefinitly

Two main logging frameworks:
        syslog
        sytemd journal

10.1: Log Locations
        Like anything in Unix/Linux, log file locations are inconsitent
        as fuck. Don't bother memorizing it.

        /var/log is your best bet, but some snowflake software can dump
        logs anywhere

        Logs can fill up quickly so its smart to put /var/log as a seperate
        disk parition

        Files not to manage
                wtmp(wtmpx)
                        Record of user logins/logouts and
                        system reboot/shutdown times

                        Binary format

                        Use last to decode info

                Some applications create binary transaction logs such as
                databases. Don't attempt to manage or view them in the terminal

        How to View Logs in the Systemd Journal
                journalctl
                        Prints messages from systemd journal

                        -u: View logs for a specific service unit
                                Ex: journalctl -u ssh

                        -f: Print new messages as they arrive
                                Ex: journalctl -f

10.2: The Systemd Journal
        systemd-journald
                Logging daemon
                
                Duplicates most of syslogs fuctionality

                Can run in tandem with syslog

                Stores mesages in binary format

                Can use journalctl to view messages

                Collects and indexes messages from:
                        /dev/log socket
                                Harvest messages from software that
                                submits messages according to syslog conventions

                        /dev/kmsg
                                Collect messages from Linux kernel. Replces
                                traditional klogd process

                        Unix socket /run/systemd/journal/stdout
                                Service sfotware that writes messages to STDOUT

                        Unix Socket /run/systemd/journal/socket
                                Service software that submit messages through
                                the systemd journal API

                        Audit messages from kernels auditd daemon

        Configuring the systemd Journal
                /etc/systemd/journald.conf
                        Default config file

                        Not edited directly
                                Any .conf files placed in /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/
                                directory is incorparated into the config

                        Includes a commented out version of each option with the
                        defaults

        Adding More Filtering Options for journalctl
                To allow users to read from the journal with sudo permissions,
                add them to the systemd-journal UNIX group

                journalctl --disk-usuage
                        Show size of journal on disk

                --list-boots
                        Show sequential list of boots with numerical
                        identifiers

                -b
                        Restrict logs to boot session

                        Ex: journalctl -b 0 -u ssh

                --since / --until
                        Show messages in time frame

                -n: Show n mo;st recent entries

                --help: Reference journalctl args

10.4: Kernel and Boot-time Logging
        Hard to store logs without depending on a
        specific implementation

        Boot time logs are stored in an internal buffer
        of limited size
                When the system is up, a user process gets
                rid of the contents

        systemd-journald
                Reads messages for kernel form device file /dev/kmsg

                journalctl -k / journalctl --dmesg
                        View messages from /dev/kmsg

        dmseg
                View kernel boot logs(Linux)

                -n
                        Set kernel log level
                        
                        1-7(Least-Most verbose)

10.5: Management and Rotation of Log Files
        logrotate
                Implements variety of log management policies

        logrotate: Cross-Platform Log Management
                Config
                        Consists of a series of specifications for
                        groups of log fields to be managed

                        Options that appear outside the context of a log
                        file specification apply to all of them
                                Can be overriden in a spec

                                Can be respecified later in file to modify defaults

                        Options
                                Compress - compress all nonconurrent versions of log file

                                Daily,weekly,monthly - Rotate log files on sepcified schedule

                                delaycompress - compresses all versions but current and next-most
                                recent

                                endscript - Marks end of prerotate or postrotate script

                                errors {email} - Emails errors to specified email

                                missingok - Doesn't complain if logfile doesn't exist

                                notifempty - Doesn't rotate the logfile if empty

                                olddir {dir} - Specifies older version of the log file
                                be placed in dir

                                postrotate - Introduces script to run after log rotation

                                prerotate - Introduces script to run before log rotation

                                rotate {n} - Includes n version of the log in the rotation scheme

                                sharedscripts - Runs scripts only once for the entire log group

                                size {logsize} - Rotates if log file size > logsize(e.g; look, 4M)

                Normally run with cron once a day

                Config File - /etc/logrotate.conf

                Can define .conf files in the /etc/logrotate.d folder as well
