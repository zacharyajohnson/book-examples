TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol
        Network system that underlies the Internet

        Hardware and OS independent

        Works on networks of any size topology

        ARPANET
                Progenitor of Internet

                1969 - U.S. Department of Defense

        Internet
                Collection of private networks owned by
                Internet Service Providers(ISP) that
                connect at peering points

        Who Runs the Internet

                        Nonprofit

                        Umbrella organization for technical development of the Internet

                        Parent company of Internet Engineering Task Force
                                Oversees most technical work

13.2: Networking Basics
        TCP/IP is a set of network protocols designed to work together

        IP
                Internet Protocol

                Routes packets from one machine to another

                RFC 791

        ICMP
                Internet Control MEssage Protocol

                Defines low level support for IP
                        Error messages, routing assistance, debugging

                RFC 792

        ARP
                Address Resolution Protocol

                Translates IP addresses to hardware addresses

                RFC 826

                Used in other protocol suites

        UDP
                User Datagram Protocol

                Implements unverified one way delivery

                RFC 768

        TCP
                Transmission Control Protocol

                Implements reliable, full duplex, flow controlled,
                error corrected conversations

                RFC 793

        Arranged in a hierachy, where higher level protocols use the lower
        level ones

        IPV4 and IPV6
                IPV4
                        Been in use for 5 decades

                        4 byte IP addresses

                IPV6
                        Newer version of IPV4

                        16 byte IP addresses

                        Technelogically surperior and easier to maintain

                        Integrates security and authentication into protocol

                TLDR for why IPV4 is still used
                        IP addresses can be cut down using
                        Network Area Translation(NAT)

                        Big name websites such as Amazon, Twitter, and
                        Stackoverflow use them still

                        Lack of motivation to go to IPV6 even though its better

13.3: Packet Addressing
        Network packets must be properly addressed to reach destination

        Addressing schemes
                MAC(Media Access Control)
                IPV4 and IPV6
                Hostnames

        Hardware(MAC) Addressing
                Link layer

                Each of a hosts network interfaces has one

        IP Addressing
                IP level

                Hardware independent, used in a particular networks
                context

                Identifies a specific and unique destination

                Not globally unique with the help of NAT

                NAT
                        Uses one interfaces IP to handle traffic for multiple
                        machines

                Mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses are implemented
                at the link level

        Hostname "Addressing"
                IP addresses are too hard to remember

                Hostname
                        Can be associated with an IP so a user can
                        type that instead

                        Can be set by
                                /etc/hosts
                                LDAP database
                                DNS

                        Refer to network interfaces

        Ports
                IP addreesses are not specific enough to address individual
                processes or services

                TCP/UDP - Extend IP addresses with ports

                16 bit number(1 - 65,535)

                Supplemants an IP to specify a communication channel

                Example services such as SSH and SMTP have standard ports

                Defined in /etc/services

                TCP and UDP ports are unrelated and must be handeled
                seperatly

                First 1000ish port numbers are reserved

        Address Types
                IP layer defines serveral addresses that have counterparts
                at the link layer
                        Unicast - Addresses that refer to a single network interface

                        Multicast - Addresses that simultanously target a group of hosts

                        Broadcast - Addresses that include all hosts on a local subnet

                        Anycast - Addresses that resolve to any one of a group of hosts

13.4: IP Addresses: The Gory Details
        IP addresses consist of a network portion and host portion
                Network portion
                        Identifies a logical network the address applies to

                Host portion
                        Identifies a node on the network

        IPV4
                4 bytes

                Network / host portion set administratively

        IPV6
                16 bytes

                Network / host portion 8 bytes each

        IPV4 addresses are written as decimal numbers, one for each
        byte seperated by periods
                Ex: 209.85.171.147

        127.
                "Loopback network"

                Fictious network, has no real hardware interface
                and only one host

                127.0.0.1
                        Refers to current host

                        Hostname is "localhost"

        ip address
                Set interfaces IP address

        IPV4 Address Classes
                Traditionally IPV4 addresses were seperated into classes

                Depended on first bits of letmost byte

                Determined which bytes were the network / host portion
                        Today an explicit mask sets this

                Historical IPV4 Address Classes
                        A
                                1st byte: 1 - 127
                                Format: N.H.H.H
                                Comments: Very early networks, or reserved for DOD

                        B
                                1st byte: 128 - 191
                                Format: N.N.H.H
                                Comments: Large sites, usually subnetted, were hard to get

                        C
                                1st byte: 192 - 223
                                Format: N.N.N.H
                                Comments: Were easy to get, often obatined in sets

                        D
                                1st byte: 224 - 239
                                Format: None
                                Comments: Multicast addresses, not permanently assigned

                        E
                                1st byte: 240 - 255
                                Format: None
                                Comments: Experimental addresses

        IPV4 Subnetting
                To allow better allocation of IPV4 addresses, you can reassign
                the network / host portion allocation

                Called "subnet mask" / "net mask"
                        4 bytes

                        1s correspond to Network
                                Must be contingous and left most

                        0s correspond to Host

                        8 bits most be assigned to Network and 2 bits
                        to the Host

                        Ex: Class B Network N.N.H.H
                                255.255.0.0

                        Assigned using ip or ifconfig

                        ipcalc
                                Helps calculate host / network allocation

13.5: Routing
        Direct packet from source to destination
        In between the two is a maze of networks
        Takes the form of rules("routes")

        Routing info is stored in a table in the kernel

        Routing Tables
                ip route show / netstat -r
                        Show routing table

                A host can only route packets to gateway
                machines through a directly connected network

                ip route add
                        Add route to table
                        Static

                Dynamic routing
                        Dameon proceses that communicate with each
                        others host to discover / modify routing

13.6: IPV4 ARP and IPV6 Neighbor Discovery
        IP is hardware independent, however, hardware
        addresses must be known to send data through link layer

        IPV4 - ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)
        IPV6 - Network Discovery Protocol

        Ex: Host A wants to send a packet to Host B on same Ethernet
                If the host is not on the same network, Host A
                uses routing to determine the next hop and uses
                ARP / ND to find router hardware addresses

        Every machine has a ARP / ND cache
                Contains most recent queries

                ip neigh
                        Show cache
                        ip neigh show

13.7: DHCP: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
        Allows computers to get an IP address, routing, and
        local DNS server during network connection

        Leases network / admin parameters from an authorized
        central server
                IP addresses and netmasks
                Gateways(default routers)
                DNS name servers
                Syslog hosts
                WINS servers, X font servers, proxy servers, NTP servers
                TFTP servers(for loading a boot image)

        Client must report to server periodically or lease of item expires

        Can assign info however it wants to as long as its not assigned(addresses)

        Supports static addresses
                Concentrates config to server

                Client doesn't neet to care
                
13.9: Basic network Configuration
        Steps to add a machine to a local network
                Assign a unique IP address and hostname

                Configure network interfaces and IP addresses

                Set up a default route and perhaps fancier routing

                Point to a DNS server that allows access to the
                rest of the Internet

        Hostname and IP Address Assignment
                Many ways to map hostname to IP
                        /etc/hosts
                        LDAP
                        DNS

                /etc/hosts
                        Oldest and simpliest way

                        Contains local mappings

                        Must be maintained on each client

                        Good to use if you don't want the rest
                        of the world to know about a mapping

                        Can mix IPV4 / IPV6 addresses

                        Each line is formatted as: IP hostname

                        hostname
                                Sets hostname of machine
                                /etc/hostname

        Network Interface and IP Configuration
                Network interface
                        A piece of hardware that can be potentially connected
                        to the Internet

                Every system has at least two network interfaces
                        A virtual loopback interface (localhost)

                        One real network card or port

                Multiple Ethernet jacks usually have seperate
                network interfaces

                ip link show
                        Show all network interfaces

                Modern network interfaces have autonegation, where
                it tries to set configurations based on what the user might want
                        Disable if you manually configure an interface

                ip config
                        Set IP address for an interface

                        IPV4
                                Needs netmask as well

                                Possibly disable broadcasting

        Routing Configuration
                See chapter 15 for more info

                ip route
                        Command to work with routes

        DNS Configuration
                Configure via /etc/resolv.conf
                        Lists DNS domains that should be used to
                        resolve that are incomplete
                                Ex: anchor vs anchor.cs.colorado.edu
                        and the IP addresses of the name servers to
                        contact for name lookups

                        Should list most stable nameserver first, contacted in order

13.10: Linux Networking
        ifdown {interface} / ifup {interface}
                Bring interface up/down

                Needed after config changes

        Network Manager
                Service run in background

                Includes system app tray for configuring
                network interfaces

                Can handle transient wireless networks,
                wireless broadband, and VPNs

                More fluid and designed to be run by users

                Widely adopted by Linux distros

                Good for laptops which change networks
                frequently

                Might be a hinderance in servers / desktops

        ip: Manually configure a network 
                ss - Used to examine state of network sockets

                ip
                        Used for network configuration

                        Second argument is used to specify
                        what object you want to modify / examine
                                link
                                address
                                route

                        Man pages are divided by subcommand
                                Ex: man ip-link

                        Also understands help
                                Ex: ip link help

        Linux TCP/IP Options
                Can be found in /proc
                        /proc/sys/net/ipv4
                        /proc/sys/net/ipv6

                        TCP / UDP configs are in ipv4
                        folder

                        ipv4/conf or ipv6/conf
                                Contain parameters
                                set on an interface level

                                Includes all or default folder to
                                apply to all interfaces

                sysctl - set /proc variables until reboot
                
                For permenant changes add the variable to
                /etc/sysctl.conf

13.12: Network Troubleshooting
        General guidelines
                Make one change at a time. Check if it had the intended
                effect. If not, revert it

                Document the situation as it was before you got involved
                and every change you make along the way

                Start at the top of the TCP / IP stack and work
                down to isolate the layer that is the issue

        ping: Check to See if a Host is Alive
                ping / ping6
                        Sends a ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet to
                        a targtet host to see if it responds

                        Used to test status of host and segments of
                        network

                        Most stuff needs to be configured for this
                        command to succeed

                        ping -n
                                Prevents reverse lookups on IPS

                                Good way to test if DNS is broken

                        Includes a summary for diagnosis

        Packet Sniffers
                Listen to network traffic and record or print packets
                that match criteria of your choice

                tcpdump
                        Command line packet sniffer

                        Read / write files in tcpdump / libcap format

                        tcpdump -i: Force interface to use
                        tcpdump -n: Don't do DNS name lookups
                        tcpdump -v: More verbose output
                        tcpdump -vv: even more output
                        tcpdump -w: Store dump to file
                        tcpdump -r: Read dump from file

                Wireshark
                        tcpdump on steroids

                        Includes GUI (Wireshark) and CLI (tshark)

                        Can read / write trace files used in other packet
                        sniffers

                        Capture filters are identical to tcpdump since it use libcap

                        Don't run for prolonged periods since it can be an attack vector
