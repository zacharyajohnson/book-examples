User level programs like to refer to resources by name
        Ex: www.google.com

Low level networking only understands IP addresses
        Ex: 192.22.0.1

DNS
        Provides mappings between names and IP
        addresses

        Have other features but exist to support mapping

16.1: DNS Architecture
        Distribute database
                One site stores data for computers it knows about

                Sites cooperate with each other when one site needs
                to look up the others data

        Queries and Responses
                DNS query
                        Consists of
                                Name
                                Record type
                        
                        Answer returned is a set of "response records"
                        that are response to query OR a response indicating
                        that it does not exist

                        Servers that don't know the answer to a query return
                        resource records that hlep locate a server that does

                Record - Query for names IP address

        DNS Service Providers
                Today if an org maintains a DNS server, it is for internal use only

                External facing DNS servers are typically provided by 3rd parties
                        Amazon Route53
                        CloudFlare
                        GoDaddy
                        DNS Made Easy
                        Rackspace

                75% of DNS Servers run some form of the Berkely Internet Name Domain(BIND)
                DNS Service System

16.2: DNS For Lookups
        Want clients to lookup names in DNS

        Two steps
                Configure systems as DNS clients

                Tell when to use DNS vs other systems such
                as /etc/hosts

        resolv.conf: Client Resolver Configuration
                Configure client side DNS resolver in
                /etc/resolv.conf

                Lists the name servers to which the host
                can send queries

                If host gets IP / network params from DHCP, this
                is usually generated automatically

                Format
                        search domainname ...
                        nameserver ipaddress

                Up to 3 name servers can be listed

                Ex:
                        search atrust.com booklab.atrust.com
                        nameserver 63.173.189.1
                        nameserver 174.129.219.255

                        Search line lists the domain to query if a hostname is not
                        fully qualified
                                SSH coraline will look for coraline.atrust.com 
                                or coraline.booklab.atrust.com

                                Allows 6-8 domains listed. 

                                Character limit of 256

                        DNS servers are contacted in order

        nsswitch.conf: Who Do I Ask for a Name?
                Specifies how host hame to IP address mappings should be
                performed and whether DNS should be tried first, last,
                or not at ll

                No best way to configure, depends on use case

16.3: The DNS Namespace
        Organized into a tree taht contains both forward mappings and
        reverse mappings

        Forward mappings - Map hostnames to IPs
        Reverse mappings - Map IPs to hostnames

        Every complete hostname is a node in the forward
        branch of the tree

        Two types of top-level domains
                Country Code Domains(CCTLDs)
                Top-Level Domains(gTLDs)

        Registering a Domain Name
                Can obtain a second level domain name individually
                        Ex: blazedgoat.com

                Identify two hosts that will be name servers for domain

16.4: How DNS Works
        Name Servers
                Answers queries about your sites hostname and IP addresses

                Asks about both local and remote hosts on behalf of your users

                Caches answers to queries for faster response time

                Communicates with other local name servers to keep DNS data
                syncronized

                Deal with "zones"
                        Domain minus subdomains
                        "Domain is typically used to mean zones

                Operates in serveral modes

                A single server can play differnt roles with respect to
                different zones

                Name Server Taxnonmy
                        Authoritative - Offically represents a zone

                        Master - Master server for a zone, gets data from disk file

                        Primary - Another name for master server

                        Slave - Copies its data from master

                        Secondary - Another name for slave server

                        Stub - Like a slave, but only coopies server data (not host data)

                        Distributed - A server advertised only within a domain("Stealth Server")

                        Nonauthorative Caching - Answers query from cache; doesn't know if valid
                        Caches data form pervious queries, usually has no local zones

                        Forwarder - Performs queries on behalf of many clients; builds large cache

                        Recursive - Queries on your behalf until it returns either an answer on an
                        error

                        Nonrecursive - Refers you to another server if it can't answer a query

        Authorative and Caching-Only Servers
                Master, slave, and caching servers are distinguished by two things
                        Where the data comes from

                        Whether the server is authroitative for the domain

                Each zone has one master server
                        Keeps data on disk

                        Offical copy of data

                Slave server
                        Gets data from master server through a "zone transfer"
                        operation

                        Zones can have many but at least must have one

                Caching server
                        Loads servers for root domain and caches query results

                An authoritative answer from a name server is guarunteed to be correct

        Recursive and Nonrecursive Servers
                Nonrecursive
                        Either returns an asnwer or refers to another server that
                        might know the answer

                        All Authoritative-only servers (root servers, top level domain servers)
                        are this since they process so many records

                Recursive
                        Only returns answers / errors

                        Will follow refferals to get an answer

                        Resolver libraries don't understand refferals
                        Any servers in resolv.conf MUST BE RECURSIVE

        Resource Records
                Contains info about hosts

                Single line consisting of a name, record, type,
                and some data values

                Name filed can be omitted if its the same as the previous line

                Ex:
                        "Forward" file called atrust.com
                        nubark IN A 63.173.189.1
                               IN MX 10 malserver.atrust.com

                        "Reverse" file called 63.173.189.rev
                                1 IN PTR nubark.atrust.com

                        Associates nubark.atrust.com with IP 63.173.189.1


                Flow around DNS system and become cached at various locations

        Delegation
                All name servers read the identities of the root servers from
                        A local config

                        Build into code itself

                Root servers
                        Know about namer servers for com, net, edu, etc

                edu servers
                        Known about colorado.edu, berkely.edu, etc

                Each domain can delegate authority for its subdomains to other servers

        Debugging With Query Tools
                BIND commands to query DNS database
                        nslookup
                        dig
                        host
                        drill
                        delv

16.5: The DNS Database
        A set of text files (zone files) maintained by the
        sysadmin on the zone's master name server

        Two entries
                Parser commands
                Resources records

        Parser Commands in Zone Files
                Embedded in zone files to make it easier
                to maintain / readable

                Can
                        Influence how parser interprets later records

                        Expand to multiple DNS records

                Ex:
                        $ORIGIN
                        $INCLUDE
                        $TTL
                        $GENERATE(BIND only)

                Must start in colum one and occur on a line by themselves

                $ORIGIN
                        Set / change default origin

                        Ex: $ORIGIN {domain-name}

                $INCLUDE
                        Include file into zone file

                        Origin - acts if $origin was used in last line
                                Careful doesn't reset after include

                        Ex: $Include {filename} [origin]
                $TTL
                        Sets default value for time-live for records that follow it

                        Ex: $TTL 24h or $TTL 1d or $TTL 86400

        Resource Records
                Format - [name] [ttl] [class] type data

                Fields are seperated by whitespace (tabs or spaces)

                Special characters
                        ; - Introduces comment
                        @ - Current zone name
                        () - ALlows data to span lines
                        # - Wild card (Name field only)

                Fields
                        Name
                                Identifies entity (host or domain)

                                Can be omitted if lines refer to same entity

                                Column 1

                                Relative or absolute

                        TTL (Time to live)

                                Specifies length of time, in seconds, that
                                the record can be cached and still be considered
                                valid

                        Class
                                Specify network type

                                IN(Internet) is default

                        4 Main types
                                Zone Infrastructure Records
                                        Identify domains and their name servers

                                        SOA (State of authority)
                                                Defines a DNS zone

                                        NS(Name Server)
                                                Identifies Servers, delegates, subdomains

                                Basic Records
                                        Map between names and addresses and rotate mail

                                        A (IPV4 Address) - Name to address translation

                                        AAAA (IPV6 Address) - Name to IPV6 address translation

                                        PTR (Pointer) - Address to name translation

                                        MX (Mail Exchanger) - Controls email routing

                                Security Records
                                        Add authentication and signatures to zone files

                                        DS (Delegation Signer) - Hash of signed child zones key-signing key

                                        D NSKEY (Public Key) - Public key for a DNS name

                                        NSEC (Next Secure) - Used with DNSSEC for negative answers

                                        RRSIG (Signature) - Signed, authenicated resource record sent

                                Optional Records
                                        Provide extra info about hosts or domains

                                        CName (Canonical Name) - Nicknames or aliases for a host

                                        SRV (Service) - Give locations for a well known service

                                        TXT (Text) - Comments or untyped info

                                Order of records is arbritrary. Tradition is:
                                        SOA records

                                        NS records

                                        Records for each host should be kept together

                                        Sorted by name field

16.6: The BIND Software
        Berkely Internet Name Domain System

        Open source, implements DNS for Linux, UNIX, macOS, and Windows

        Components of BIND
                Four
                        Named - name server daemon that snwers queries

                        Resolver library that queries DNS servers on behalf of user

                        Command-line interfaces to DNS
                                nslookup
                                dig
                                host

                        rndc - A program to remotely control named

        Configuration Files
                Zone data files - address mappings for each host

                Root name server hints file

                named.conf
                        Config file for named

                        Has its own format compared to DNS data records

                        Specifies roles for host, master, slave, etc

                        Specifies manner host should obtain its copy of the data
                        for each zone it serves

                        Very fragile syntax

                        Series of statements

        The Include Statement
                Used to bring a file into another config file

                Ex: include {path}
                        If relative, interpreted with the directory option

        The Options Statement
                Specifies global options

                May be overriden later for particular zones or servers

                Ex:
                        options {
                                option;
                                option;
                        }

                If no options statement is present, default values are used

                Over 170 options in BIND

        The ACL Statement
                Access Control List

                Is address match list with a name

                Ex:
                        acl acl-name {
                                address-match-list
                        }

                Use it anywhere an address match list is used

                Must be top level statement

                Must be defined before they are used in named.conf

                Four predefined lists
                        any - all hosts

                        localnets - all hosts on local networks

                        localhost - the machine itself

                        none - nothing

        The (TSIG) Key Statement
                Defines a "shared secret" (password) that authenticates
                between two servers

                Ex: 
                        key key-id {
                                algorithm string;
                                secret string;
                        }

                Associate key with a server, include key-id in servers
                server statement

                Shared secret is confidential and should not be kept in a
                world-readable file

        The Server Statement
                Tells named about the characteristics of servers it talks to

                Can override defaults for a server

                Not required unless you want to configure keys for zone transfer

                Ex:
                        server ip_addr {
                                bogus yes | no; [no]
                                provide-ixfr yes | no; [yes]
                                request-ixfr yes | no; [yes]
                                keys { key-id; key-id; ... } [none]
                                transfer-source ip-address [port];
                                                           [closest interface]
                                transfer-source-v6 ip-address [port];
                                                              [closest interface]
                        };

        The Masters Statement
                Names a set of one or more master servers by specifying their
                IP addresses and cryptographic keys

                Name can be used instead of IP / key in masters clause of zone
                statements

        The Logging Statement
                Most configurable logging system on Earth

        The Statistics-Channel Statement
                Allows connection a running namwed with a browser to
                view statistics

                Ex:
                        statistics-channel {
                                inet (ip-addr 1 *) port port# allow
                                { address-match-list };
                        }

        The Zone Statement
                Tell named about the zones that its in charge of and
                set options to manage them

                Used by caching servers to preload root server hints

                Format depnds on role for a particular zone

                Configuring a master server for a zone
                        zone {domain-name} {
                                type master;
                                file {path}
                        }

                        Where path is the file path to a zone file

                Configuring a slave server for a zone
                        zone {domain-name} {
                                type slave;
                                file {path};
                                masters { ip-addr [port] [key]; };
                                allow-query { address-match-list };
                        };
