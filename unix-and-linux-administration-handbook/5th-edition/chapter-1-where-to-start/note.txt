1.2: Suggested Background
        Text Editors:
                vim(vimtutor command)
                nano
        Scripting:
                Bash or sh
                        Bash is used on most Linux distros
                        Try and be POSIX compliant(sh)
                Python
                Ruby
                expect
1.3: Linux Distributions
        Comprised of the Linux kernal(core of OS) and packages that make
        up all the commands you can run on the system
        
        Share the same kernal

        Format, type, and packages differ

        Focus, support and popularity differ

        Include a desktop environment and package manager

        List of distros can be found on www.distrowatch.com
        
        Unix
                Complete OS, not just the kernal
1.7: Man Pages and Other Online Docs
        Manual Pages
                "man" pages
                read with man command
                docs found on machine
                Contains docs for:
                        commands
                        drivers
                        file formats
                        library routines
        Organization of Man Pages
                Divided into sections
                Sections:
                        1 - user-level commands/app locations
                        2 - system calls and kernal error codes
                        3 - library calls
                        4 - device drivers and network protocols
                        5 - standard file formats
                        6 - games and demostrations
                        7 - miscellaneous files and documents
                        8 - system administration commands
                        9 - obscure kernal specs and interfaces
        man {title}
                finds a man page based on title
                title is a command,device,filename,etc
                can be sent through commands such as more or less. Defined by PAGER env variable
        man {section} {title}
                gets man page from a section
                Ex:
                        man sync(user command)
                        man 2 sync(sys call)
        man -k {keyword}/apropos {keyword}
                prints a list of man pages that have keyword in
                their one line synopses
        makewhatis(Red Hat/FreeBSD) AND mandb(ubuntu)
                update keywords database
        Storage of Man Pages
                /usr/share/man
                        stored source code of man pages
                        uses nroff text formatter for terms
                        compressed with gzip
                                man can uncompress automatically
                /var/cache/man OR /usr/share/man
                        cache of preformatted pagesw
                        catman
                                processes man pages
                                performats them
                        much faster to read/process then then sources
                manpath
                        search path where man will look for man pages
                        path can be set by the MANPATH env variable

1.10: Ways to Find and Install Software
        modern OS's devide contents into packages that can be installed independtly of each other
        Package Format
                Ex: yum, apt, pacman
                compile source code of software and distribute the binary using the in a package repo(OS specific)
                just because two distros use the same format doesn't mean they can use the same binary
                        each distro has different conventions that make them different
                if need be a piece of software can be installed manually from source code
        Determining if Software is Already Installed
                Which command
                        Finds binary location
                        searches based on PATH variable
                Whereis command
                        similar to which
                        searches more directories
                        independent of PATH variable
                        can find binary, source, and man page file locations
                locate {pattern}
                        FreeBSD includes this. For Linux needs to be installed
                        can find any type of file
                        searches a precompiled index of the filesystem
                                update the index with updatedb command
        Adding New Software
                first, find the canonical name of the software package
                command to add package is based on distro
                        Ex: 
                                Debian: sudo apt-get install
                                Red Hat: sudo yum install
                                FreeBSD: sudo pkg install -y
        Building Software from Source Code
                find the source code
                        usually a git repository
                        a lot can be found on github or gitlab
                download the source code
                follow the softwares install/build guide
                        look for install or readme files
        Installing from a Web Script
                typically driven by a shell script downloaded with curl
                        Ex:
                                curl -o /tmp/saltboot -SL https../
                                sudo sh /tmp/saltboot
                Issues
                        no record of installation
                                always prefer OS packages
                        unsecured HTTP
                                only use HTTPS
                        partial script execution
                                Ex:
                                        curl -L https://... | sudo sh
                                if curl fails due to a network exception, could execute 
                                a partial script or mess up OS environment

                                fix is split it into two steps
                                        curl -L https://...
                                        sudo file sh
